*   SETL4 is an implementation of SETL written in SPITBOL.


*   What is SPITBOL?
*   ----------------

*   SNOBOL is a general programming language with special emphasis on processing 
*   strings and text that was  developed at Bell Labs in the 1960's by a team 
*   led by Ralph Griswold. The final version was called SNOBOL4.

*   Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL, is a very efficient implemenation of SNOBOL4.
*   Created by Robert B. K. Dewar and Ken Belcher in 1969, SPITBOL/360 
*   was written in IBM/360 assembly language, in what Dewar called
*   "aggressive assembly."
*
*   For example, SNOBOL4 requires maintaining a count of the number of 
*   statements executed and the ability to stop execution when a specified 
*   number of statements have been executed.  SPITBOL/360 does this by
*   computing an unnormalized floating point constant such that successive 
*   increments result in floating point overflow when the limit is reached.

*   Dewar and Belcher also wrote Realia COBOL, a COBOL compiler for Intel/x86 
*   written in COBOL. It produced very efficient code, better
*   code than, for example, that produced by IBM's product COBOL compiler.

*   Dewar ported SPITBOL/360 to several machines. Dewar joined the CIMS faculty
*   as a Professor in the early 1970's. In 1973, while working
*   with Anthony P. "Tony" McCann of Leeds University, he developed
*   Minimal, a portable assembly language. Dewar and McCann then rewrote
*   SPITBOL in Minimal, producing Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL. 
*   The implementation has proved very stable, with few changes in
*   several decades.

*   Macro SPITBOL is remarkably small. The code consists of about 28,000
*   lines: 2000 lines of comments defining Minimal, 5000 lines of constant/data 
*   declarations, and 21,000 lines of code.  Every line has a comment.
*   The executable for x86 Linux is 144 kilobytes.

*   SPITBOL was implemented for many machines and operating systems by
*   a small team that included Steve Duff, Mark Emmer, Bob Goldberg, and Dave Shields:
*   ICL 1900, Univac, CDC 6600, IBM PC, Apple Macintosh, SUN Solaris Sparc, 
*   Microsoft (DOS/NT/Windows), Intel x86_64 (Unix/Linux), and x86_64 Apple iOS.  
*   Special credit is due Mark Emmer, who led the project from the mid 1980's
*   to 2009. Dave Shieldsl has maintained SPITBOL since then.


*   What is SETL?
*   -------------

*   SETL (SET Language)  is  a programming language with  finite sets as 
*   the fundamental data type. It was created by Jacob T. "Jack" Schwartz 
*   of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS) of New York 
*   University (NYU).

*   Jack founded the SETL project in 1970. It was later funded by two 
*   five-year grants from the Office of Naval Research.

*   SETL was used to write NYU Ada/Ed, the first validated Ada compiler.
*   Devloped on the DEC Vax 11/780, Ada/Ed was ported to the IBM PC (DOS)
*   by a team led by Dave Shields.


*   Why the name SETL4?
*   -------------------

*   The SETL Project produced three implementations of SETL. The first was
*   written by Dave Shields in BALM, a language developed by Prof. Malcom 
*   Harrison of CIMS, the second by Henry S. "Hank" Warren in PL/I while on 
*   leave from IBM, and the third by Robert B. K. Dewar and Art Grand in LITTLE,
*   a low-level implementation language developed at CIMS.

*   SETL4 is the fourth implementation of SETL produced by a member 
*   (Dave Shields) of the NYU SETL project, hence the name SETL4.


*   Brief Introduction to SETL4
*   ---------------------------

*   SETL4 extends SPITBOL by adding the datatype _set_ to represent
*   finite sets. 

*   For example, the folowing SETL4 expression determines if the integer _P_ is prime:

*           !exists(|'int 2 P' @ 'multiple(P,this)')

*   where _multiple(a,b) is true if and only if _a_ is a multiple of _b_.

*   Sets in SETL4
*   -------------

*   SETL4 provides several kinds of sets.

*   Sets of kind 'set' are a collection of distinct members.

*   Sets of kind 'map' consist of a series or ordered pairs,
*   called entries. The first element of an enter is the key,
*    the second is the value.  No two entries in the map can 
*   have the same key but different values.

*   Sets of kind 'iterator' consist of positive integers of the form

*   low, low + step, ... high

*   For example 'iterator 5 25 5' is the set {5 10 15 20 25}.
*   Iterators support efficient iteration, and suppor only the
*   operations of iteration and membership.

*   Sets of kind 'integer' define a map on the positive integers.
*   The members usually, but not necessarily consist of a sequence
*   of integers with no gaps; for example 'sequence 5' is a map defined
*   on 1, 2, ... 5.

*   Sets of kind 'sequence' ('seq') are a map defined on a set of positive integers
*   that usually, but not necessarily, consists of a consecutive sequence of integers.

*   Sets of kind 'string' consists of a map from integers to characters.

*   By convention, the kinds are writtten 'int', 'iter', 'map', and 'set'.

*   Additonal SETL4 data types
*   --------------------------

*   SETL4 provides the following data types in addtion to _set_: 

*       _entry_   _line_   _token_

*   where 

*       entry(key,value)            is an entry in a map;
*       line(mark,text)             is a line of text and an associated mark (tag); and
*       token(lineno,ndx,type,text) is a lexeme, or lexical token.

*   Show
*   ----

*   The function _show_ writes out the value of a SETL4 object in a readable 
*   form. Objects are shown in the order defined by the function _rank_.


*   SETL4 Binary Operators:
*   -----------------------

*   '&'     a & b   And             True if and only if both _a_ and _b_ are true
*   '@'     s @ e   Eval            Evaluates _e_ at current element of set _s_
*   '#'     s # e   Filter          Returns subset of set _s_ for which _e_ is true
*   '~'     m ~ s   Membership      Tests if _m_ is member of set _s_
*   '^'     a ^ b   Or              True if and only if _a_ or _b_ is true


*   SETL4 Unary Operators:
*   ----------------------

*   '='     =s      Iteration       Returns the current element of an iteration
*   '|'     |'str'  Constructor     Returns set specified by string _str_
*   '!'     !expr   Not             True if and only if _expr_ is false
*   '#'     #s      Size            Number of elements in set _s_
*   '/'     /s      Split           Splits a string into a sequence of words

*   Set Data Type
*   -------------

*   A set is defined by the following datatype:

    data('set(set.index,set.key,set.kind,set.size,set.next,set.low,set.high,set.max,set.step,set.text,set.seq,set.this)')

*   where

*           _set.index_         a SPITBOL table used to map the integer
*                               id assigned each element to the value of the element.
*                               It is used to support fast iteration.

*           _set.key_           a SPITBOL table mapping set elements to index entries.

*           _set.kind_          is the kind of the set, one of 'set', 'map', 'int, 
*                               'seq'. The kind is  specified when the 
*                               set is created. The default value is 'set'.

*           _set.size_          the current number of members.

*           _set.next           is iteration index when iterating over set
*                               when iterating over a 

*           _set.low_           lower bound of _int_ 

*           _set.high_          upper bound of _int_ 

*           _set.step_         number of values between members of set of kind _int_.

*           _set.text_          is the text of the set of kind _str_

*           _set.this           the last value returned by the _next_ primitive

*           _set.max'           maximum number of elements. This applies to sets of kind 'integers'.

*   Sets of integers
*   ----------------

*   SETL4 sets of kind _integers' provide an efficient implementation of a set of 
*   integers, in the form of a string such that an integer _i_ is in the set only
*   if the i-th character of the string is '+'. The string is represented by a 
*   table in blocks of 100 characters, so that the first block represents the integers 
*   1 .. 100, and so forth. New chunks are allocated only when necesary.  The SPITBOL 
*   function BREAK is used to find the next element in the set when iterating over the set.

*   Maps
*   --------------

*   In mathematics, a map defined on a finite set is a set of 
*   ordered pairs, or entries,  that define a relation between the 
*   first element of an entry, its _key_, and the second element 
*   of the entry, the value of the map for _key_.

    data('entry(key,value)')

*   The SPITBOL datatype TABLE provides the machinery to implement maps.
*   SPITBOL provides no way to determine the number of entries in a table
*   other than converting the map to an array. This is the only way in 
*   SPITBOL to iterate over a SPITBOL table.

*   For this reason, maps are implemented using two tables: _index_ and _key_.
*   Each new entry added to a map is given an integer id, starting with one.  
*   The field _index_ maps the id's to the associated pairs.
*   The entries in _index_ allow efficient iteration over the  
*
*   The table _key_ maps keys in the map to the corresponding entry in the map.
*   The entries in _key_ permit efficient retrieval of the map's value for a given key.

*   SETL4 also provides the datatype _stack_ that implements a stack, providing
*   the funcitons _push_ and _pop_. Stacks are created by the function _new.stack_.

    data('stack(stack.stack,stack.top)')



*   SETL4 Configuration Options
*   ---------------------------

*   Initial size of any hash tables created when constructing
*   a new instance of a 

*   _setl4.config.size_ is default size for the _index_ and _key_ tables of a set.

    setl4.config.size = 32

*   _setl4.config.integers.max_ is maximum number of elements in set of kind 'integers'.

    setl4.config.integers.max = 1000
    setl4.config.integers.max = 50

*   SETL4 needs a stack

    setl4.stack = stack()

*   a set _B_ whose elements are exactly those elements _x_ of _A_
*   for which _S(x)_ holds.

*   In SETL4 we say that the expression '_A_ @ _S_' "filters"
