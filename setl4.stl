*TODO - need separate out iterator from set data structure. May have multiple loops over same set at onece.
*TODO - need equal for general equality test on sets, maps, etc.

*   SETL4 is an implementation of SETL written in SPITBOL.


*   What is SPITBOL?
*   ----------------

*   SNOBOL is a general programming language with special emphasis on 
*   processing strings and text. *   It was  developed at Bell Labs 
*   in the 1960's by a team led by Ralph Griswold.
*   Their final version was called SNOBOL4.

*   Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL, is a very efficient implemenation of SNOBOL4.
*   Created by Robert B. K. Dewar and Ken Belcher in 1969, SPITBOL/360 
*   was written in IBM/360 assembly language, in what Dewar called
*   "aggressive assembly."
*
*   For example, SNOBOL4 requires maintaining a count of the number of 
*   statements executed and the ability to stop execution when a specified 
*   number of statements have been executed.  SPITBOL/360 does this by
*   computing an unnormalized floating point constant such that successive 
*   increments result in floating point overflow when the limit is reached.

*   Dewar and Belcher also wrote Realia COBOL, a COBOL compiler for Intel/x86 
*   written in COBOL. It produced very efficient code, better
*   code than, for example, that produced by IBM's product COBOL compiler.

*   Dewar ported SPITBOL/360 to several machines. Around 1973, while working
*   with Anthony P. (Tony) McCann of Leeds University, he developed
*   Minimal, a portable assembly language. Dewar and McCann then rewrote
*   SPITBOL in Minimal, producing Macro SPITBOL, or SPITBOL. 
*   The implementation has proved very stable, with few changes in
*   several decades.

*   Macro SPITBOL is remarkably small. The code consists of about 28,000
*   lines: 2000 lines of comments defining Minimal, 5000 lines of constant/data 
*   declarations, and 21,000 lines of code.  Every line has a comment.
*   The executable for x86 Linux is 144 kilobytes.

*   SPITBOL was implemented for many machines and operating systems by
*   a small team that included Steve Duff, Mark Emmer, Bob Goldberg, and Dave Shields:
*   ICL 1900, Univac, CDC 6600, IBM PC, Apple Macintosh, SUN Solaris Sparc, 
*   Microsoft (DOS/NT/Windows), Intel x86_64 (Unix/Linux), and x86_64 Apple iOS.  


*   What is SETL?
*   -------------

*   SETL is  a programming language with  finite sets as the fundamental data type.
*   It was created by Jacob T. "Jack" Schwartz of the Courant Institute of 
*   Mathematical Sciences (CIMS) of New York University (NYU).

*   Jack founded the SETL project in 1970. It was later funded by two 
*   five-year grants from the Office of Naval Research.

*   SETL was used to write NYU Ada/Ed, the first validated Ada compiler.
*   Devloped on the DEC Vax 11/780, Ada/Ed was ported to the IBM PC (DOS)
*   by a team led by Dave Shields.


*   Why the name SETL4?
*   -------------------

*   The SETL Project produced three implementations of SETL. The first was
*   written by Dave Shields, the second by Henry S. (Hank) Warren while on 
*   leave from IBM, and the third by Robert B. K. Dewar and Art Grand.

*   SETL4 is the fourth implementation of SETL produced by a member 
*   (Dave Shields) of the NYU SETL project, hence the name SETL4.


*   Brief Introduction to SETL4
*   ---------------------------

*   SETL4 extends SPITBOL by adding the datatype _set_ to represent
*   finite sets. 

*   SETL4 supports a variety of sets. Each has a kind, one of:

*       _int_   _map_   _seq_   _set_   _str_

*   For each kind, SETL4 provides set-theoretic functions, 
*   as well as other functions that have proven to be useful.

*   For example, the folowing SETL4 expression determines if the integer _P_ is prime:

*           !exists(|'int 2 P' @ 'multiple(P,this)')

*   where _multiple(a,b) is true if and only if _a_ is a multiple of _b_.

*   Additonal SETL4 data types
*   --------------------------

*   SETL4 provides the following data types in addtion to _set_: 

*       _entry_   _line_   _pair_    _token_

*   where 

*       entry(key,value)            is an entry in a map;
*       line(mark,text)             is a line of text and an associated mark (tag); and
*       token(lineno,ndx,type,text) is a lexeme, or lexical token.

*   Int: Set of kind 'int'
*   ----------------------'

*   A set of kind _int_ represents a sequence of positive integers.
*   The set cannot be changed once it is created. You can only loop 
*   over a set of kind _int_ or test for membership.


*   Map: Set of kind 'map'
*   ----------------------
*   A map is a set of ordered pairs.


*   Seq: Set of kind 'seq'
*   ---------------------

*   A sequence (_seq_) is a map on the positive integers 1 .. n
*   Sequences are implemented using SPITBOL arrays, and so are very efficient.


*   Set: Set of kind 'set'
*   ----------------------

*   A set is a collection of distinct elements.


*   Str: Set of kind 'str'
*   ----------------------

*   A string sequence (_str_) is a sequence of characters.


*   Show
*   ----

*   The function _show_ writes out the value of a SETL4 object in a readable 
*   form. Objects are shown in the order defined by the function _rank_.


*   SETL4 Binary Operators:
*   -----------------------

*   '&'     a & b   And             True if and only if both _a_ and _b_ are true
*   '@'     s @ e   Eval            Evaluates _e_ at current element of set _s_
*   '#'     s # e   Filter          Returns subset of set _s_ for which _e_ is true
*   '~'     m ~ s   Membership      Tests if _m_ is member of set _s_
*   '^'     a ^ b   Or              True if and only if _a_ or _b_ is true


*   SETL4 Unary Operators:
*   ----------------------

*   '='     =s      Iteration       Returns the current element of an iteration
*   '|'     |'str'  Constructor     Returns set specified by string _str_
*   '!'     !expr   Not             True if and only if _expr_ is false
*   '#'     #s      Size            Number of elements in set _s_
*   '/'     /s      Split           Splits a string into a sequence of words

*   Set Data Type
*   -------------

*   A set is defined by the following datatype:

    data('set(kind,index,key,size,next,low,high,step,text,seq,this)')

*   where

*           _kind_          the kind of _set_: 'int', 'map', 'seq', 'set', or 'str'.

*           _index_         a SPITBOL table used to map the integer
*                           id assigned each element to the value of the element.
*                           It is used to support fast iteration.

*           _high_          upper bound of _int_ 

*           _low_           lower bound of _int_ 

*           _key_           a SPITBOL table mapping set elements to index entries.

*           _next           is iteration index when iterating over set
*                           when iterating over a 
*           _seq_           is the array used to maintain a sequence.

*           _size_          the current number of members.

*           _step_          number of values between members of set of kind _int_.

*           _text_          is the text of the set of kind _str_

*           _this           the last value returned by the _next_ primitive


*   Note that the null value is not allowed as an element of a set or the
*   value of a map key, but can be used as the value of an element in a seq.

*   The _key_ table is needed to provide constant time bounds for iterating over
    define('integers(n)i')                      :(integers.end)

*   a set, in all of its forms.

*   a set _B_ whose elements are exactly those elements _x_ of _A_
*   for which _S(x)_ holds.

*   In SETL4 we say that the expression '_A_ @ _S_' "filters"
*   _A_ by _S_. This can also be read as
*           "the subset of _A_ such that _S_ is true"

*   Returns the subset of set or map _set_ for which _expr_ is true.

*   Maps
*   --------------

*   In mathematics, a map, or function, defined on a finite set is a set of 
*   ordered pairs that define a relation between the first element of a pair, 
*   its _key_, and the second element of the pair, the value of the map for _key_.


*   where _key_ is the key, and _value_ is the value of the map for _key_.

*   The SPITBOL datatype TABLE provides the machinery to implement maps.
*   SPITBOL provides no way to determine the number of entries in a table
*   other than converting the map to an array. This is the only way in 
*   SPITBOL to iterate over a SPITBOL table.

*   For this reason, maps are implemented using two tables: _index_ and _key_.
*   Each new entry added to a map is given an integer id, starting with one.  
*   The field _index_ maps the id's to the associated pairs.
*   The entries in _index_ allow efficient iteration over the  
*
*   The table _key_ maps keys in the map to the corresponding id in _index_,
*   from which the entry for the key can be found. The entries in _key_
*   permit efficient retrieval of the map's value for a given key.


    define('member(set,elem)kind,entry,i,key,this,value)') :(member.end)

*   Tests if _elem_ is 'elem' of _set, where:

*   _elem_ is element of 'int' if in range, and

*   _elem_ is element of 'int' if in range, and
*   meets requirement if 'step' in nonzero

*   _elem_ is element of map _set if _map_ has entry _elem_.

*   _elem_ is element of sequence _set if _set has entry _elem)

*   _elem_ is element of set _set if _in(elem,set)_ is true.

*   _elem_ is element of string _set if _set contains instance of _elem.
