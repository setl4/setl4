*## Global variables

*   Global variables have names that start with prefix 'g.'

*   _g.lines_ is a sequence giving all the lines in the sonnets.

*   _g.numeral_ maps a sonnet's number to its equivalent in roman numerals.

    g.numeral = new('map #14')

*   _G.word.str_ is a string that defines a word as used in the sonnets.
*   In addition to letters, Shakespeare used single quotes within words;
*   as for example, "lov'd."

    g.word.str = &ucase &lcase "'"

*   _G.sonnets_ is a sequence giving the sonnets.  Each sonnet has fourteen lines.

    g.sonnets = new('seq #150')

*   _g.words_ is the set of all the words used in the sonnets.

    g.words = new('set #3000')

*   _g.count_ is a map from words to the number of times the word
*   occurs in a sonnet.

    g.count = new('map #3000')

*   _g.uses_ is a map from words to a string giving all the lines in the
*   the sonnets containing an instance of the word.

    g.uses = new('map #3000')

*   _g.sonnet.this is the number of the current sonnet during the find.

    g.sonnet.this = 0

*   Analyze the text of the sonnets.

    define('list(sonnet,title)line')                :(list.end)
